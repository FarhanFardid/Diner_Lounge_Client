          <h3>Where Can I Get Some?</h3>
          <p>
            Experience a fiery delight with our featured item at Diner Lounge
            Restaurant: the `Spicy Shrimp Stick`. Succulent shrimp marinated in
            a tantalizing blend of spices, skewered and grilled to perfection.
            Each bite delivers a burst of flavor, combining the smoky char from
            the grill with the zing of our secret spicy sauce. Served with a
            side of cool cucumber salad to balance the heat.{" "}
